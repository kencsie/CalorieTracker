# 本次會議內容
 - Discussed Recommender System Paper
 
# 研究生的建議
- NLP Required (Possiblly More Complicated)
- Deep Learning Model
- Look for more papers related to the methodology for the calorie system（Preferrably with code)
- More papers related to our final goal（Recommendation system is new goal)
     
- Potentially 2 models:
    - Calorie estimation system
    - Recommendation system (new goal)
- Output of estimation system as input of recommendation system.

# 下周進度
- Division of work amongst group members (Multiple teacher, multiple student learning strategy)

# Recommendation System
- Deep Learning
- After estimation of calories and identification of nutrition facts, customized recommendations can be made per user.
