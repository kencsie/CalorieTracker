## **Features**

- **Food Recognition**: Utilizes YOLOv5 to detect and identify food items from uploaded images.
- **Food Segmentation**: Implements the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for accurate food segmentation.
- **Dimension and Mass Estimation**: Leverages Depth Anything for dimensional analysis and Support Vector Regression (SVR) for food mass prediction.
- **Nutritional Analysis**: Provides comprehensive nutritional breakdowns for recognized food items.
- **Personalized Meal Recommendations**: Uses an LLM (GPT-4) to generate tailored recommendations based on usersâ€™ physical characteristics (e.g., age, weight, height) and dietary patterns.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple, intuitive interface for easy navigation.
