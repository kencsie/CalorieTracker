# 教授的建議
- Proposed redesign of the overall system:
    - Food image decomposition into mass calculation and dish ingredients
    1. Users determine which ingredients they enjoyed (Produces list)
    2. Second output of ingredients (Requires counsel from the professor/TAs)
    3. Processing of nutrition facts (3 main steps):
        a) Output of system A produces Calorie Values and Nutrition facts.
        b) Nutrition facts are compared against the general daily intake levels for an adult and the difference is taken and fed into system B.
        c) System B determines which individual ingredients can make up the difference in nutrients and enumerates them into a list. This list is fed as input into the recommender system.
    4. Recommender system scrapes web to return healthy dishes containing the ingredients the user likes.
