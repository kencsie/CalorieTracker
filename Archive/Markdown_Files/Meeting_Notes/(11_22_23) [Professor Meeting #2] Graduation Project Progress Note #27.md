# 教授的建議

- Decide on the importance of using two models over just one good model. (Think about using a Nutrition System and a Recommendation System, or just a single Nutrition Sysytem)

- Potenteially ask the manager of lakeside for his cooperation in soliciting preparation information for the foods in the cafeteria
