## Meeting Contents
- Dry run of presentation with TAs and determined areas that require work
   
### Architecture Diagram
1. Picture of the coin in addition to the masks :heavy_check_mark: 
2. Show all 5 bounding boxes poining to the segmentation model :heavy_check_mark: 
3. Connect all the appropriate inputs to the right thing (connected the label to the recognition model) :heavy_check_mark:
4. Show the end of the Nutriton System connected to the Recommender System (A -> B) :heavy_check_mark:
5. Include brief overview of the recommender system (Like brief input & output of that) :x: 

### Presentation
6. Embolden the name of the model (YOLO) :heavy_check_mark: 
7. For the dataset slide, just show pictures and explain them 

### Model Research
9. Find examples to show the capabilities of SAM :heavy_check_mark: 
10. Test MLP model, determine inputs and outputs, then attempt to modify to fit our needs :heavy_check_mark: 
11. Research how many images are needed to train a capable model (from papers or other resources) :heavy_check_mark: 


-------------------------------------------
- Whether the SAM model requires the label (NO)
- Potential model for machine learning MLP (Multi Layer Perception) [Machine Learning]
