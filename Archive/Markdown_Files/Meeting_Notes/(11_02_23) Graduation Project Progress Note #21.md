## 會議內容
- Discussion of the PFoodReq paper and presented the current level of understanding as it relates to the contents of the paper

## 助教的建議
- Determine how many pictures we would need to train the model
- Come up with strategy to efficiently take pictures for the training of the model

- Decide how the model itself will be trained

- Attempt to look for pretrained model for recommendation model (or shrink the size of the dataset to make training easier)

- Allocate the majority of resources towards the first model (Nutrition System) and enhance it or actually realize its operation.

## IMPORTANT
- **Group meeting with professor has changed to November 22, 2023 (Wednesday - 3 Weeks from now)**

### Negotiables
- Foods with high sauce content, be weary of the amount that touches other foods

- ***Current goal is 500 images in total (~125/person)***

- Model may produce better results if there is higher contrast between the surface and the plate itself (if unable to get high contrast environment, please use a tablecloth if possible)

### Non-Negotiables
- Users must include a calibration object (like a 10NTD coin)

- Foods cannot be too close together (Must have a white background between the boundaries of the foods)

- Remove other silverware or utensils from the image area (may obstruct identification of the calibration object)

- Take images from a reasonable distance (Such that all foods to be identified are clear, and the coin is clearly in view)

- Images should be taken at default focal length (1x zoom) and must have a 1:1 aspect ratio (Square Image)

- Users are advised to take clear photos so that after resizing, minimal image quality is lost
