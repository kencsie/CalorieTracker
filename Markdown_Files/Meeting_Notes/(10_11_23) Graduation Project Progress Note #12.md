# 本次會議內容
- Brief discussion of findings from last meeting (Sunday 8th, October)
- Explain the example of recommender system (NPA)

# 會後討論 (To-do)
- Continue with understanding of resources (both systems)
- Both teams look for resources on recommended daily calorie intake values [BMR Intake Equations]

## Recommender System (Continue As Before)
### Ken
1. Continue with research on daily intake levels for weight maintenance
