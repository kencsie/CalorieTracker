  Since the user has consumed a 400-calorie breakfast, the meal plan should strategically allocate the remainder of the daily nutritional targets across lunch and dinner.

  Please prioritize the following available foods with their nutritional content (per 100g serving), adjusting the amounts to meet the exact nutritional targets:

  - Seafood: Kabayaki sea bream fillet (127 kcal, 18.3g protein, 3.2g fat, 6.2g carbs), Fish cake (201 kcal, 13.65g protein, 10.49g fat, 12.38g carbs)
  - Meat and Meat Products: Spam (292 kcal, 15g protein, 24.3g fat, 3.2g carbs), Pig blood curd (29 kcal, 6.3g protein, 0.3g fat, 0.5g carbs)
  - Tofu and Tofu Products: Creamy tofu (196 kcal, 13.4g protein, 13.4g fat, 6.3g carbs), Egg tofu (82.35 kcal, 7.06g protein, 5.29g fat, 1.18g carbs)
  - Vegetables: Cabbage (42 kcal, 0.99g protein, 2.79g fat, 4.36g carbs), Pumpkin (115 kcal, 2.7g protein, 4.38g fat, 19.85g carbs)

  The meal plan should incorporate the user's preferred foods: ['Guava -sliced-', 'Pumpkin', 'Creamy tofu', 'Cabbage', 'Kabayaki sea bream fillet', 'Egg tofu', 'Pig blood curd'], ensuring the following:

  Correct proportions of macronutrients to fulfill health objectives.
  Accurate serving sizes to meet the specific gram targets for each food group.
  A diverse range of foods to provide a balanced intake of nutrients.
  Formulate lunch and dinner menus that will bring the user's total daily intake in line with the Health TEA recommendations. The menus should be designed to maximize nutritional value while satisfying taste preferences. It is essential that the meal plan does not exceed the specified daily limits for each macronutrient and aligns precisely with the serving size definitions.

  Please adjust the quantities of each food item so that the total fat content does not surpass 25 grams and the total intake of vegetables and fruits meets the required amounts in grams. If any macronutrient exceeds the daily goal, suggest alternative quantities or food items that will correct the imbalance.
