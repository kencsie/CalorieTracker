# 會後討論 (To-do)
## Recommender System
 - Try to learn by using one algorithm first (Content Based Filtering Methods) [Reference](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start/dkn_MIND.ipynb)
 - Read up on proposed material to determine its usability in the project
 - If found, propose other literature and useful information
 ### Ken
 1. Understand the benefit of LLM with recommender system
     - necessary: understand the concept
     - ideal: find one paper
 2. Test some of the algorithms. Read up on how they work
     - Neural Recommendation with Personalized Attention (NPA)
     [NPA](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start/npa_MIND.ipynb)
     - Deep Knowledge-Aware Network (DKN)*
     [DKN](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start/dkn_MIND.ipynb)
 3. Search for theory related to weight loss/maintenance/gain
 [BMR Estimation Calculation for Weight Maintenance (Section 3.8)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349152789_A_Recommender_System_for_Healthy_Food_Choices_Building_a_Hybrid_Model_for_Recipe_Recommendations_using_Big_Data_Sets#:~:text=To%20calculate%20BMR,4.7%20*%20age)
 ### Kenrick
 1. Read up on more theory for recommender systems
 2. Test some of the algorithms. Read up on how they work:
     [LightGBM/Gradient Boosting Tree](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start/lightgbm_tinycriteo.ipynb)
     [Term Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start/tfidf_covid.ipynb)
 3. Search for theory related to weight loss/maintenance/gain
     [BMR Estimation Calculation for Weight Maintenance (Section 3.8)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349152789_A_Recommender_System_for_Healthy_Food_Choices_Building_a_Hybrid_Model_for_Recipe_Recommendations_using_Big_Data_Sets#:~:text=To%20calculate%20BMR,4.7%20*%20age)
 
## Calorie estimation System
### Jimmy
 1. Read up on proposed material to determine its usability in the project
 [Masters Student's Github](https://github.com/ChetanJarande31/Food-calorie-estimations-Using-Deep-Learning-And-Computer-Vision)
 2. If found, propose other literature and useful information
 3. Find the feasibilty of the Nutrition5k dataset with YOLOv5
 [Nutrition5k](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Nutrition5k)
 4. Look though these papers and try to understand the implementations (assist Trang)
